    // Vertex Data -> Vertex Shader -> Primitive Assembly -> Rasterization -> Fragment shader -> Testing & blending -> Screen buffer
    
    // **** Programable stages were we have the most control

    // - Vertex Shader ****
    // A program that runs in the GPU (receives a group of points / vertices from the screen space)
    // Forming the shape of an object or mesh.

    // - Primitive Assembly
    // Vertices are assembled into complete triangles.

    // - Rasterization
    // Takes the primities and fill the area with pixels called fragments. The output is
    // a ollection of fragments that covers the area of the shape.

    // - Fragment Shader ****
    // Another GPU program. It works with individual fragments. Determines the color of each
    // pixel, so it helps to color different parts of an object.

    // - Testing & Blending
    // This ensures that new pixels are correctly combined with what was already in the frame
    // buffer.
